# Case Study of Well Dot, Inc.

## Overview and Origin

[Well Dot, Inc.](https://www.well.co) "Well", based in Chapel Hill, NC, was founded in January 2019 by Gary Loveman, former CEO of Caesars Entertainment Corp., and David Werry, who had a background in healthcare investment <sup>[^1]</sup> The idea for the company culminated from Loveman's experience in  developing analytics within the gambling industry that was used to influence customer behavior. [^2] According to one of Well's blog entries, Loveman was interested in the fact that his hospitality employees were adept at identifying actions that steered customers towards outcomes favorable to the company yet could not use the skill very well when applying it towards improving their own health. He became focused on coming up with and testing techniques such as providing on-site clinics that would encourage his employees to actively participate in actions beneficial to their healthcare.[^3]

Loveman further explored the idea in later ventures including as Executive Vice President of Aetna. While in that position, he recruited David Werry who worked together with him *to help individuals understand their health potential and take actions toward achieving it.* [^4] Aetna was eventually purchased by CVS, prompting Loveman and Werry to part ways from their employer and form their own company which would focus on technology that incentivized consumers to take care of their health needs.

In 2019 the newly formed company, received $25 million seed funding from investors including from General Catalyst, John Doerr, Mosaic Health Solutions and Hellman & Friedman partners. [^4] They entered in agreement with North Carolina to build their headquarters in Chapel Hill, Orange County and create 400 jobs in return for $3.9 million in tax rebates so long as hiring and investment targets are met across a 12 year period. [^5] A year later in 2020, Well raised nearly $40 million in Series A (e.g. funding after initial seed money used for development and growth) type funding in form of debt (e.g. loans) and equity (e.g shareholder offerings). [^4] As of 2023, their latest funding for Series B occurred in 2022 raising $70 million to be used in additional expansion and technological advancement. [^6] Their continued success in achieving investor funding suggests the company is on track towards future profitability.  

## Business Activities

Well wants to retool the healthcare industry from today's reactive, medical-condition or illness-focused approach towards a consumer first approach that incentivizing sustainable and holistic well-being across a lifetime. Well describes their objective as follows [^6]:

> Our purpose is to improve health through compelling, frequent engagement. We work with users to build a relationship based on their individual health history, challenges and desires. With our AI Health Engine, clinically-driven content, and Well Guides, we offer a persistent presence in their lives that moves them step-by-step towards their own own \[sic\] goals and overall health improvement. Ours is a high-touch, but low-pressure habit-forming approach that uses proven consumer engagement tactics and incentives to make members successful in advancing their health.

Ultimately, the company seeks to be a companion tool for a broad range of users across demographics and healthcare needs. In 2022, they reached 1000 members via obtaining corporate clients that provide the tool as an optional health care benefit to their employees and from cultivating partnerships with community health organizations and direct-to-user consumer brands. [^6] Conspicuously, Well has not prominently named any of their corporate clients or partnerships so far which does not inspire confidence however, they are still a young company with solid investment backing that is expected to grow. They have recently partnered with UNC-Chapel Hill and UNC Healthcare. [^12]

Given the universal need for health and wellbeing, the customer base potential for a healthcare engagement tool is significant. Well is interested in motivating and empowering their users to engage in their health needs differently than what the American healthcare industry incentivizes (e.g. reactive illness treatment focus rather than ongoing proactive health management) and intends to be a driver for change. The Well company's website mentions that there is a thriving marketplace attempting to address consumer experiences for more than 100 million people.[^6] Despite this, there isn't yet competition in the niche Well is creating for itself which can be described as technological tools for incentivized lifelong health engagement. 

 Being first gives them a window to grow a customer base without competition and obtain brand recognition for a niche area that may later morph into mass market appeal. Another strength for the company is their leadership, they are adept at obtaining funding which may not be possible for much smaller less networked entrepreneurs and startups. Well may be able to remain strongly competitive even if heavyweight corporations enter the marketplace so long as they continue on a path of growth, customer adoption, customer retention, and innovative tool development. 

The company's tool, currently a downloadable health app called [Well Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.well.wellapp), is powered by a proprietary algorithm that uses "clinical interventions and guided experiences data" to provide tailored healthcare support to their members. [^6] Considering the company's employment requirements for Software Engineers, Data Engineers and Senior Data Scientist [^7] their tool uses Python, Haskell programming language; their AI must involve large language modeling, unsupervised learning, and deep learning and requires data processing pipelines, and modern cloud platforms.

## Landscape

The healthcare industry is experiencing major transforming innovation across many areas due to its mutualistic relationship with technological advancements such as AI, 3D printing, gene editing and virtual reality. [^8] While Well promotes admirable ideals with its vision of change in the American approach to healthcare; Well Digital could be broadly categorized under telehealth and is closest aligned with virtual assistant/conversational AI technology given the caveat that Well's application focuses on lifelong preventative measures and incentivizing sustained self-stewardship of healthcare needs.

AI powered chatbot technology is a recent major trend related to virtual assistance in healthcare. Chatbots are being used to interact and provide more accurate medical information to consumers thereby broadening health care access for people that may not otherwise be reachable due to location, medical illness, cost, or other factors.  [^9]

The growth rate of chatbot tech is projected to accelerate in a similar manner as the growth of websites in the mid to late 1990's. [^10]

Chatbots have evolved significantly since its 20th century inception:

- 1960 \- 2000: The first generation of chatbots such as ELIZA (1966) used decision trees and keyword recognition to supply answers
- 2010 \- 2014: The next generation introduced natural language processing and machine learning to chatbots tech such as IBM Watson and Alexa
- 2021 \- 2023: The current generation of AI is modeled on massive data sets and are the tech behind generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT.

According to [Engati](https://www.engati.com/blog/chatbot-industry-trends), a company that has developed a conversational automation platform:
> AI-powered conversational UX is the next big thing for enterprise businesses. "CUX is a newer version of UX design". And itâ€™s expected to gain more significance in the next few years. Businesses are focusing on brand persona development, personalized content, and guided conversations to help users reach their goals faster. Overall, this helps keep up sales, search rankings, etc. 

Continual advancement in AI natural language processing, data processing, and machine learning is prompting rapid improvement in information provided to patients and fuels the chatbot technology. Improved communication and information discernment among healthcare practitioners has increased for a more holistic big picture approach to care. [^9]

Although unique in scope, Well Digital shares commonalities and overlap with tools from other companies in the field working in a similar vein of virtual assistance technology. 

- [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/en-us), now part of [eMed](https://www.emed.com/uk/about) was an early contender in evangelizing proactive healthcare through technology. Established in 2013, their vision was to provide accessible and affordable care on a global scale and they offer a digital-first AI powered platform for primary care and chronic healthcare management.

- [Buoy](https://buoyhealth.com), founded in 2014, offers an AI that assists users with checking symptoms and connects them to vetted medical content. 

- [Curai](https://curaihealth.com), started in 2017, offers a virtual care app for doctors and patients to directly interface. The company owns a proprietary AI and Machine Learning platform that is mining from state-of-the-art medical research data. [^11]

## Results

Well Dot Inc.'s headquarters in Chapel Hill is influencing tech firms to establish a presence in the town.[^12] The next steps for the company will determine whether the startup proves a success. Currently, the company is experiencing rapid expansion and is well-funded for further growth and development. Its impact in healthcare technology remains to be seen. They have no direct contenders in this interesting new avenue for healthcare. Their vision adherence and use of AI may lead to further innovation and new offerings for the company and may in turn push healthcare equity forward for all Americans.  

## Recommendations

1. Explore accessibility driven AI. Introduce specialized voicebots and enhanced visualization that cater to different populations. In particular, the elderly population is projected to double by 2050.[^17] Today's tech-savvy younger consumers will be tomorrow's elderly. With aging comes cognitive changes, increasing mobility limitations, and unmet or hidden social needs that could potentially be met through AI powered assistance. For example, cognitive decline may make communicating a challenge. A dementia-friendly AI, could elicit healthcare related responses from the consumer by patiently posing spoken queries while providing visual cues that help the consumer understand the question or assists them in conveying their needs. The user may be able to respond verbally or by touching one of the images. 

2. Join the research on early digital detection of dementia. Scientists from Regenstrief Institute, and two US medical schools; Indiana University and University of Miami, are exploring the use of algorithms to review electronic health records to determine if patients are showing signs of dementia. They called their algorithm a passive digital marker; Well Digital could potentially adapt or generate a similar algorithm that detects trends or markers for a variety of health conditions using data created from its interactions with the consumer. [^18] Providing this additional use case would further incentivize Well users to interact habitually with Well Digital as the algorithm will have more data to evaluate for any concerning trends. The additional functionality adds value by providing peace of mind that is attractive to consumers.


3. Consider making Well's AI algorithm partly or fully open-sourced rather than proprietary. This would establish Well's reputation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) as it opens the field to others that may be able to use the algorithm for future technology. Perhaps, it may be used to help improve the state of American healthcare and beyond. Good CSR is good PR in that it aligns Well's business with their advocacy of health engagement for all. CSR companies benefit from increased press coverage and are able to attract talented employees and retain them. [^14] [^15] Well would also potentially gain a pool of talent that they could hire that already understand their technology. [^16]
